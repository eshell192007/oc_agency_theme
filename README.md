A simple clean layout designed for portfolio websites.

## Building

- Once downloaded and placed in your `theme` directory, run: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
- Run `yarn run build` or `npm run build`

## Developing on:

- If you want to extend the theme, you can run `yarn run server` or use `npm` to start webpack's watch mode and run the October development server. Or run `yarn run watch` (or use `npm`) to just start webpack in watch mode.
